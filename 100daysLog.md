#100 Days Of ML Code

## Hi! I am Mohan, a Machine Learning Enthusiast and this is my log for the 100DaysOfMLCode Challenge

### Day 1: Sep 14, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I started with revising the basic concept on Descriptive & inferential statistics.

**Thoughts:** Revised the Basic Concept of Statistics.
Descriptive statistics -> Central Tendency (Mean, Median & Mode), Measure of Spread (Variance, Standard Deviation, IQR, deciles & percentiles). Box-Whisker Plot to get an intitution on outliers.
Basic concept of Probability-> Joint Probability,Conditional Probability,Normal Distribution,Binomial Distribution,Probability Mass Function,Probability Density Function, Standardized Normal Distribution using Z-Score & Cumulative Distribution function.

### Day 2: Sep 15, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Practiced Statistics & Probabality in python.

**Thoughts:** Seeing how to implement the concept learnt as a theory yesterday cleared the concepts much more. I will implement the code for the same tomorrow.
